Volumes below are based on 15cm dish - adjust to if necessary. 
As written this protocol works well to fix SWI/SNF. 

1. Replace media with 15mL fresh media
2. Add 1.5mL 3.3% HCHO in PBS = final concentration 0.3% (adjust if necessary)
3. Incubate 30 minutes rocking at 4 degrees (could perform 10 minutes at RT also). 
4. Add 1/10 volume 2M glycine
5. Incubate 5 minutes at RT
6. Wash 3 times in cold PBS
7. Scrape in 2.5mL cold PBS + 1mM PMSF into 50mL conical - fill with PBS
8. Spin 2000 RPM X 7 minutes at 4 degrees
9. Transfer to microfuge tubes at 2e7/ tube ( enough for 1-4 IPs)
10. Spin 3 minutes at setting 3 in cold room microfuge
11. Remove supernatant and snap freeze in LN2
